# Dynamic Ontology for Mental Health Classification based on RDoC Framework

We present a dynamic ontology for the structured classification of mental health dimensions within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework.

---

This ontology is designed to flexibly respond to emerging research and incorporate new findings into the evolving structure of the RDoC domains and constructs.

It includes comprehensive categories, ranging from broad systems like Negative Valence or Cognitive Systems to specific constructs such as fear, working memory, or cognitive control, providing a nuanced hierarchy of mental health attributes.

With continuous updates and refinements, our ontology ensures a precise and current representation of psychological constructs across multiple units of analysis, from genes to behavior.
